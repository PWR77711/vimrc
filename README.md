# vimrc

My personal vim configuration being used on my laptop as well as on servers I
have to deal with. Optimized for PHP.

## Installation
Quick installation instructions:

    cd
    git clone https://github.com/porn/vimrc.git
    ln -s vimrc/.vimrc .
    ln -s vimrc/.vim .

## TODO
 - rename files, complete installation part
 - categorize configs
 - features (describe <Fx> shortcuts)
 - set font for gvim
 - install spellchecker
 - move PHP specific settings to php ftplugin

## Hotkeys

The config uses a lot of various key bindings. For full list see the `.vimrc` file directly=)
Note: `<leader>` is set to the comma (`,`) key.

 - `<leader>/` - unhighlight the last search occurrences
